###### As Savvy Susan, you’ve grown used to being able to solve every challenge thrown your way. The moment you get accepted at your dream job as the train conductor of the 2 train for the MTA, you are assigned the task of making sure your train is never delayed. :railway_car: :railway_car: :railway_car: 

###### As impossible as that may seem to you, you accept this daunting endeavor. In order to achieve that kind of perfection, you calculate that you must find the best path through all the stations to the Chambers Street Terminal. Will you accept this responsibility and make sure that a Stuy kid is never late to their first-period class again? The player will be a train operator with the goal of picking up all of the waiting passengers (number proportional to the level; as level number increases, amount of passengers to pick up increases) and reach the Terminal in a certain amount of steps. The operator will have to create his own path which he must follow to collect all of the people and then reach the terminal. :checkered_flag:

###### This game’s objective is also to improve the player’s *typing skills.* In order to move in a particular direction, Savvy Susan will have to type a word assigned to the direction.  

###### For example: 
######
- Left: Banana :banana:
- Right: Apple :apple:
- Up: Down :arrow_up:
- Down: Up :arrow_down:

###### If the player types Down, they will move Up. Mistyping a word will result in a number of steps deduction, and going in the wrong direction will derail Savvy Susan. As the levels increase, the word difficulty will increase, as well as the amount of time you have to complete the level. :clock2: :clock4: :clock6:
